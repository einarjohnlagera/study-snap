# quiz-session.md - NoteLib Feature Context

## Goal

Quiz sessions persist progress separately from generated Study Pack content so users can leave and resume review safely.

## Session Modes

Shared session storage supports:

- `QUICK_REVIEW`
- `CHALLENGE`
- `ADAPTIVE`

## Dashboard Resume Metadata

Dashboard resume recommendations must stay note-based even though session data lives on quiz-session rows.

The backend should join:

- quiz session
- study pack
- note

Required resume metadata:

- `noteId`
- `noteTitle`
- `subject`
- optional `courseProgram`
- `resumeType`
- `currentQuestionIndex`
- `totalQuestions`
- `lastReviewedAt`

Rules:

- `resumeType` comes from session mode, not frontend heuristics
- dashboard resume payloads should use one API response
- note metadata should prefer current note values over older generated Study Pack metadata when both exist
- if note metadata is missing, fallback display should still remain usable
